/*
Package notary is a Go client for interacting with Notary repositories.

The "notary" command uses this package to communicate with a Notary server and
produced signed metadata. It can also be used by your own Go applications to do
anything the command-line interface does - viewing signatures, producing
signatures, managing keys, etc. 

For more information about Notary, see the documentation:
https://docs.docker.com/notary/getting_started/
